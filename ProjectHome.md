The mobile application will offer a crime prevention and tipster reporting channel. Members will be able to list crimes where they were the victims as well as load any information that might help the SAPS or alerting neighbors. They will also be allowed to upload photos of suspects. This will also provide a means for individuals, who have information on criminal activity to report that information anonymously. The aim is to increase the safety of the local community by assisting law enforcement in removing undesirable individuals from the community.
